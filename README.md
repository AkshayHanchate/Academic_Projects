Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my academic projects related to Regression diagnostics, Regularization, GLM, and Logistic Regression using R.

Project 1: Regression Diagnostics with R
Description: This project focuses on analyzing regression models using diagnostic tools in R. Through this project, I delved into various regression diagnostic techniques to assess the assumptions and performance of regression models.

Project 2: Regularization Techniques in Regression
Description: In this project, I explored regularization techniques such as Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression using R. The main goal was to understand how these techniques help in addressing overfitting and improving the generalization capability of regression models.

Description: This project involves the implementation of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Logistic Regression in R. GLMs extend traditional linear regression models to accommodate various types of response variables and error distributions, making them versatile for a wide range of data analysis tasks. Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is a fundamental technique for binary classification tasks.
